[open-source][beamforming]

Hi! Excited to share something I've been working on that might be useful for the community: a Python+CUDA-accelerated beamforming kernel that is 10x faster than current (open-source Python) beamformers. We hope that the speed-up will unblock researchers (like us at Forest) who need to beamform large ultrafast imaging datasets.

The beamformer is still an "alpha" version until we implement a few more features, and we'd love feedback from anyone who wants to try it or has API suggestions! We have some examples for plane wave imaging and Doppler.

Happy to answer questions or chat about it! Cheers! ðŸš€
